/// Configuration class for customizing YOLO streaming behavior.
///
/// This class allows fine-grained control over what data is included in
/// real-time YOLO detection streams. It provides options to balance
/// performance with data richness based on application needs.
///
/// Example usage:
/// ```dart
/// // Lightweight configuration for high FPS
/// final lightConfig = YOLOStreamingConfig.lightweight();
///
/// // Detailed configuration with all data
/// final detailedConfig = YOLOStreamingConfig.detailed();
///
/// // Custom configuration
/// final customConfig = YOLOStreamingConfig.custom(
///   includeOriginalImage: true,
///   maxFPS: 20,
///   includeMasks: false,
/// );
/// ```
class YOLOStreamingConfig {
  /// Whether to include basic detection results (bounding boxes, confidence, class).
  ///
  /// This is the core YOLO output and is typically always enabled.
  /// Disabling this will result in no detection data being sent.
  final bool includeDetections;

  /// Whether to include classification results.
  ///
  /// Relevant for classify tasks. When enabled, classification scores
  /// are included in the streaming results.
  final bool includeClassifications;

  /// Whether to include processing time metrics in milliseconds.
  ///
  /// This provides timing information for performance monitoring.
  /// Default is true to maintain compatibility with existing apps.
  final bool includeProcessingTimeMs;

  /// Whether to include frames per second (FPS) metrics.
  ///
  /// This provides real-time FPS information for performance monitoring.
  /// Default is true to maintain compatibility with existing apps.
  final bool includeFps;

  /// Whether to include segmentation masks in the results.
  ///
  /// Only relevant for segmentation tasks. Masks can be memory-intensive
  /// and may impact performance on lower-end devices.
  final bool includeMasks;

  /// Whether to include pose estimation keypoints.
  ///
  /// Only relevant for pose estimation tasks. Includes keypoint coordinates
  /// and confidence scores for detected poses.
  final bool includePoses;

  /// Whether to include oriented bounding box (OBB) data.
  ///
  /// Only relevant for OBB detection tasks. Includes rotated bounding box
  /// coordinates and angles.
  final bool includeOBB;

  /// Whether to include original camera frames without annotations.
  ///
  /// Original images are useful for custom post-processing or debugging.
  /// This significantly increases memory usage and should be used carefully.
  final bool includeOriginalImage;

  /// Maximum frames per second for streaming output.
  ///
  /// This controls how often results are sent to Flutter, not inference frequency.
  /// When set, limits the rate at which results are sent to improve
  /// performance. Null means no limit (device-dependent maximum).
  final int? maxFPS;

  /// Minimum interval between result transmissions.
  ///
  /// When set, ensures a minimum time gap between consecutive results.
  /// Useful for throttling high-frequency updates.
  final Duration? throttleInterval;

  /// Target inference frequency in frames per second.
  ///
  /// This controls how often YOLO inference is actually performed on camera frames.
  /// Lower values reduce CPU/GPU usage and heat generation but may miss fast objects.
  /// Higher values provide smoother tracking but consume more resources.
  ///
  /// Examples:
  /// - `30`: High frequency - smooth tracking, high resource usage
  /// - `15`: Balanced - good tracking with moderate resource usage
  /// - `10`: Low frequency - basic detection, low resource usage
  /// - `5`: Very low - minimal detection, battery saving
  /// - `null`: Maximum frequency (device-dependent, usually 30-60 FPS)
  final int? inferenceFrequency;

  /// Skip frames between inferences for power saving.
  ///
  /// This is an alternative way to control inference frequency by specifying
  /// how many camera frames to skip between inferences.
  ///
  /// Examples:
  /// - `0`: Process every frame (maximum frequency)
  /// - `1`: Process every 2nd frame (half frequency)
  /// - `2`: Process every 3rd frame (1/3 frequency)
  /// - `4`: Process every 5th frame (1/5 frequency)
  ///
  /// Note: If both `inferenceFrequency` and `skipFrames` are set,
  /// `inferenceFrequency` takes precedence.
