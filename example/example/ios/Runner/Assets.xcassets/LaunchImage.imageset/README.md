# Launch Screen Assets

## ðŸŽ¨ Customizing Your Launch Screen

You can customize the launch screen with your own desired assets by replacing the image files in this directory. This allows you to brand your Flutter app with your own visual identity and create a professional first impression for users.

## ðŸ“± Using Xcode for Asset Management

You can also manage launch screen assets by opening your Flutter project's Xcode project with `open ios/Runner.xcworkspace`, selecting `Runner/Assets.xcassets` in the Project Navigator and dropping in the desired images.

### Asset Requirements

- **Image formats**: PNG, JPEG, or other iOS-supported formats
- **Resolution**: Provide multiple resolutions for different device densities
- **Naming**: Follow iOS asset naming conventions for optimal compatibility

## ðŸš€ Best Practices

- Use high-quality images that represent your app's brand
- Ensure images are optimized for fast loading times
- Test on different device sizes and orientations
- Consider using vector graphics when possible for scalability
