# Performance Guide

Good performance comes from choosing the right model, limiting unnecessary work, and testing on real devices.

## 📦 Choose the Right Model

Start with the smallest model that meets your accuracy needs.

```dart
final fast = YOLO(modelPath: 'yolo26n');
```

If you need a larger custom model, load that model directly:

```dart
final accurate = YOLO(
  modelPath: 'assets/models/custom-large.tflite',
  task: YOLOTask.detect,
);
```

Use a simple rule:

- default app flow: start with `yolo26n`
- custom production flow: benchmark your exact export on target devices

## 🎚️ Tune Thresholds

Higher confidence thresholds reduce post-processing work and visual noise:

```dart
await controller.setThresholds(
  confidenceThreshold: 0.6,
  iouThreshold: 0.3,
  numItemsThreshold: 10,
);
```

Lower thresholds increase recall, but also increase work and on-screen clutter.

## 📡 Limit Streaming Work

When using `YOLOView`, cap frame rate and disable data you do not need:

```dart
final config = YOLOStreamingConfig.throttled(
  maxFPS: 15,
  includeMasks: false,
  includeOriginalImage: false,
);
```

Good defaults:

- use `maxFPS` to cap UI churn
- disable masks unless you actually render them
- disable `includeOriginalImage` unless you consume full frame bytes

## 🖥️ GPU vs CPU

`useGpu` defaults to `true`, but CPU can be the better choice on unstable devices:

```dart
final yolo = YOLO(
  modelPath: 'yolo26n',
  useGpu: false,
);
```

Use CPU when:

- device-specific GPU delegates are unstable
- startup reliability matters more than peak throughput
- you are debugging model-load failures

## 🧠 Manage Memory

Large models and multiple active instances increase memory use quickly.

Prefer:

- one active `YOLO` instance unless you truly need more
- explicit `dispose()` for single-image instances you no longer use
- one active `YOLOView` per camera screen

```dart
await yolo.dispose();
```

## 🔄 Multi-Instance Tips

Only enable multi-instance mode when you need parallel models:

```dart
final detector = YOLO(
  modelPath: 'yolo26n',
  useMultiInstance: true,
);
```

If you are comparing models, keep the set small and benchmark only what you need.

## 📱 Test on Real Devices

Do not treat simulator or emulator performance as representative.

Measure:

- model load time
- inference latency
- battery drain
- frame rate under real camera usage

## ✅ Quick Recommendations

- Start with `yolo26n`.
- Prefer metadata-carrying official models or exports.
- Cap streaming frame rate before trying to micro-optimize code.
- Disable GPU on problematic devices instead of layering in workarounds.
- Benchmark the actual export you plan to ship.
