# Performance Guide

Good performance comes from choosing the right model, limiting unnecessary work, and testing on real devices.

## 📦 Choose the Right Model

Start with the smallest model that meets your accuracy needs.

```dart
final fast = YOLO(modelPath: 'yolo26n');
```

If you need a larger custom model, load that model directly:

```dart
final accurate = YOLO(
  modelPath: 'assets/models/custom-large.tflite',
  task: YOLOTask.detect,
);
```

Use a simple rule:

- default app flow: start with `yolo26n`
- custom production flow: benchmark your exact export on target devices

## 🎚️ Tune Thresholds

Higher confidence thresholds reduce post-processing work and visual noise:

```dart
await controller.setThresholds(
  confidenceThreshold: 0.6,
  iouThreshold: 0.3,
  numItemsThreshold: 10,
);
```

Lower thresholds increase recall, but also increase work and on-screen clutter.

## 📡 Limit Streaming Work

When using `YOLOView`, cap frame rate and disable data you do not need:

```dart
final config = YOLOStreamingConfig.throttled(
  maxFPS: 15,
  includeMasks: false,
  includeOriginalImage: false,
);
```

Good defaults:

- use `maxFPS` to cap UI churn
- disable masks unless you actually render them
- disable `includeOriginalImage` unless you consume full frame bytes

For the detailed experiment log that mirrors the iOS app's canonical performance record, see [`../docs/performance.md`](../docs/performance.md).

## 🖥️ GPU vs CPU

`useGpu` defaults to `true`, but CPU can be the better choice on unstable devices:

```dart
final yolo = YOLO(
  modelPath: 'yolo26n',
  useGpu: false,
);
```

On Android, inference runs on LiteRT 2.x with an automatic **GPU → CPU accelerator ladder**: with `useGpu: true` the plugin compiles compatible graphs for the GPU, while unsupported graphs or ops may fall back to XNNPACK CPU. (iOS uses Core ML.)

The official YOLO26 int8 TFLite assets can compile on the LiteRT GPU path on supported devices, but int8 GPU coverage depends on the device driver and graph. For example, a Galaxy S26 compiled `yolo26n_int8.tflite` fully with the OpenCL delegate (`Replacing 395 out of 395 node(s) with delegate (LITERT_CL)`) and ran at about **15 FPS / 32 ms** in the live camera example app. Always confirm delegate placement with device logs instead of assuming a quantization format implies CPU or GPU.

fp16 non-end-to-end TFLite exports are still useful for GPU benchmarking:

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

YOLO("yolo26n.pt").export(format="tflite", half=True, nms=False, end2end=False, imgsz=640)
```

Use CPU when:

- device-specific GPU paths are unstable
- startup reliability matters more than peak throughput
- you are debugging model-load failures

## 🧠 Manage Memory

Large models and multiple active instances increase memory use quickly.

Prefer:

- one active `YOLO` instance unless you truly need more
- explicit `dispose()` for single-image instances you no longer use
- one active `YOLOView` per camera screen

```dart
await yolo.dispose();
```

## 🔄 Multi-Instance Tips

Only enable multi-instance mode when you need parallel models:

```dart
final detector = YOLO(
  modelPath: 'yolo26n',
  useMultiInstance: true,
);
```

If you are comparing models, keep the set small and benchmark only what you need.

## 📱 Test on Real Devices

Do not treat simulator or emulator performance as representative.

Measure:

- model load time
- inference latency
- battery drain
- frame rate under real camera usage

## ✅ Quick Recommendations

- Start with `yolo26n`.
- Prefer metadata-carrying official models or exports.
- Cap streaming frame rate before trying to micro-optimize code.
- On Android, keep `useGpu: true` for the automatic LiteRT GPU -> CPU ladder, and verify actual delegate placement on target devices.
- Benchmark the actual export you plan to ship.
